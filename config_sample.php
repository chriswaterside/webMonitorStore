    //  getKey is a way of ensuring only authorised sites store anything via this web site.
    //  The calling site must use the same key as generated by this function for the data to be stored
    //  The domain name and $json string are passed to the function and hence you can have a static key or base it on either or these two paramaeters
    //  e.g. the $key could be something like
    //         $key = md5($domain or $json);
    //         or $key = "securitykey";
//    public function getKey($domain, $json) {
//        $key = md5($domain);
//        return $key;
//    }

//    public function getKey($domain, $json) {
//        $key = "securitykey";
//        switch ($domain) {
//            case "validdomain.org.uk":
//            case "validdomain2.org.uk":
